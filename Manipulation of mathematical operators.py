print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3) #  3 / 3 = 1
                         #  3 * 3 = 9
                         #  9 + 1 = 10
                         # 10 - 3 = 7 is how it works
                         
#How to we manipulate the above equation to get 3, instead of 7?
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3) # (3 + 3) is now the calculation that will be performed
# 3 + 3 = 6
# 3 * 6 = 18
# 18 / 3 = 6
# 6 - 3 = 3
